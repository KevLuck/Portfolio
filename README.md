# Portfolio
Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio
The HTML and CSS I wrote are for a sample professional portfolio that I will add to over time to become my own portfolio. As a result of what I've learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp, I wrote the HTML and CSS from scratch, keeping in mind the following requirements:

A number of sections are included on the site, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Information.
To navigate to any section of the site, I included navigation links at the top of the page

An image of myself is included.
I've included a couple of samples of my work in the My Work section in addition to some placeholder applications I'll add to as I complete more programs during the bootcamp and on my own.

This page was designed to work on tablets and mobile devices of different sizes.
The various links and projects on the page also have hover effects.
